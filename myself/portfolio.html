        <h4>Face Mask <span> Detection</span> :</h4>
        <br><br>
        <p>Image detection with deep neural learning is something I’ve been looking forward to learn since I started my journey in data science. My background is in medical diagnostic sonography and echocardiography. And I was amazed by the application of deep learning techniques for detections of diseases/tumors using X-ray images. Although I didn’t choose to do medical images for the current project, I look forward to the applications in the future when there’s sufficient amount of medical image database, specifically ultrasound and echocardiogram images.

            For the 6th project at Metis, we’re tasked to use primarily non-tabular data (images, text, time series, audio, etc.) and build a neural network model that addresses a useful prediction and/or recommendation problem in any domain of interest.
            
            Disclaimer: I am new to machine learning and also to blogging. So, if there are any mistakes, please do let me know. All feedback is appreciated.</p>
